# Basic-Calculator-x8086
This program allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, multiplication, subtraction, and division. The code includes functionality for user input, calculation, and output display.

Here's a high-level overview of how the program works:

User Interface:

The user is prompted to choose an arithmetic operation from the list: Add, Multiply, Subtract, or Divide.

The program displays appropriate messages for user input.

Input Handling:

The program reads the user's choice and inputs for the numbers to be operated on.

It processes the input numbers using subroutines to convert them from ASCII to numeric values.

Arithmetic Operations:

The program performs the chosen arithmetic operation (addition, multiplication, subtraction, or division) on the input numbers.

The result of the operation is calculated and stored.

Output Display:

The program displays the result of the arithmetic operation to the user.

It also prompts the user to press any key to exit the program.

This Assembly code is an excellent project for understanding low-level programming concepts, such as:

Working with registers and memory.

Handling user input and output using interrupts.

Implementing basic arithmetic operations.

Using subroutines for modularity and reusability.
